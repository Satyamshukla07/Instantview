I want you to thoroughly analyze, redesign, and enhance my website https://instantview.onrender.com
. The site currently works but looks very basic. I want a modern, premium-quality appearance and improved user experience while ensuring all backend functionality, authentication, and database integrations continue working.

🔍 Step 1 — Full Audit

Visit and explore all routes, components, and forms.

Identify everything that looks unpolished or outdated (layouts, spacing, typography, alignment, animations, responsiveness, color consistency).

Detect any nonfunctional or broken UI elements, missing icons, or accessibility issues.

Check console for frontend errors or warnings and list them.

Make a note of any UX issues (e.g., confusing navigation, poor contrast, inconsistent buttons).

🎨 Step 2 — Redesign & Improve Appearance

Create a fresh, modern, and consistent UI theme using a clean design system with:

Minimalist layout

Elegant gradients

Rounded cards & soft shadows

Inter / Manrope / Poppins typography

Modern icons (Lucide / Heroicons)

Smooth animations (Framer Motion or Tailwind transitions)

Enhance the header, footer, and hero sections with glassmorphism or subtle depth effects.

Add responsive grid layouts, proper white space, and optimized mobile views.

Rework buttons, modals, and cards to feel interactive and premium.

Replace plain color blocks with gradient backgrounds and animated hover states.

Add a dark mode toggle (persisted in localStorage).

Integrate a cohesive color palette:
Primary: #4F46E5
Accent: #22D3EE
Secondary: #9333EA
Background (light): #F9FAFB
Background (dark): #0F172A

⚙️ Step 3 — Technical Cleanup

Fix all console and network errors (e.g., Unknown authentication strategy, missing env variables, 404s).

Ensure environment variables load properly in both client and server folders.

Optimize build pipeline for Vite + Express (correct .env usage).

Remove unused imports, dead code, and redundant files.

Validate that all OAuth, session, and API routes work correctly post-design.

💡 Step 4 — Add Polished UX Elements

Implement:

Smooth page transitions

Loading skeletons/placeholders

Animated button hover effects

Subtle hero section motion reveal

Responsive Navbar with mobile drawer animation

Consistent spacing and typography scale

Improve content readability and layout hierarchy.

📦 Step 5 — Deliverables

Deliver a complete working version of the redesigned site.

Maintain all functional APIs and auth flows.

Ensure fully responsive behavior across all devices.

Optimize for performance (Lighthouse > 90).

Use TailwindCSS + Framer Motion + shadcn/ui components if needed.
