4. Payment System — UPI Manual Flow

Overview: Replace previous automatic PG integration for MVP. Implement UPI manual payment flow with automated logging to Google Sheets.

Flow Steps (MVP):

User places order (must be signed in via Google OAuth)

System shows order summary + auto-calculated amount + UPI QR & UPI ID

User pays via UPI and uploads payment screenshot or enters UTR/Transaction ID

Order + payment proof auto-logged to Google Sheet (OrderID, UserID, ServiceID, Quantity, Amount, UPI ID, Screenshot URL, UTR, Timestamp, Status=Pending)

Admin gets instant WhatsApp notification and email with sheet link and payment screenshot

Admin verifies payment manually → toggles order status: Processing / Rejected

Payment rejected → admin marks Rejected, system credits wallet or refunds

Tech Notes:

Secure storage of payment screenshots (Firebase Storage/S3)

Google Sheets as live operations dashboard

Anti-fraud checks (duplicate UTR, image metadata)

Phase-2: Razorpay/Cashfree automated integration

5. Authentication — Google OAuth

Google OAuth as primary signup/login (Firebase Auth / NextAuth)

Store: Name, Email, Google UID, Profile Picture URL, email verification status

Login required before placing orders; optionally allow browsing but block submission for guest users

JWT tokens for session management

Logout & Manage Account options in dashboard
