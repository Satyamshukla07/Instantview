Goal: Implement all necessary pages, consent mechanisms, and backend logs to make the website legally compliant under Indian IT Act, Data Privacy, GST, and platform ToS.

Tasks & Implementation Details:

1️⃣ Website Pages (create and link in footer & checkout)

Create the following static pages (each with unique slug and meta description):

/privacy-policy

/refund-policy

/disclaimer

/terms-of-service

/contact-us


Content requirement:
Use business-neutral, India-compliant wording. Do not mention or use logos of “Instagram”, “Meta”, “YouTube”, “TikTok”.
Replace “Buy Followers / Views” phrases with “Social Media Exposure / Marketing Services”.

2️⃣ Checkout Page

Add mandatory checkbox above “Pay Now” button:

[ ] I have read and agree to the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Refund Policy.

Ensure required attribute is enforced in HTML/JS so payment can’t proceed without consent.

Add hyperlinks to the policy pages in the checkbox text.

Log user IP + timestamp + consent flag in database (e.g. consent_log table).

Fields: user_id, ip_address, datetime, consent_version (for version control).



3️⃣ Security & Privacy

Force HTTPS (SSL) for all pages.

Add cookie notice if analytics or tracking scripts are used.

Store customer name, email, and payment data only for order processing; mask sensitive fields.

Disable public exposure of user data through APIs or search engines (use robots.txt + noindex meta).


4️⃣ Payment Gateway Compliance

Add “Refund & Refill Policy” and “Privacy Policy” URLs in dashboard (required).

5️⃣ Branding & Legal Safety

Remove any references to “Instagram”, “Meta”, or other brand names/logos.

Replace with neutral icons or SVG placeholders (e.g., “social” icon set).

Footer text:

© [Year] [Brand Name]. All rights reserved. 
We provide independent digital marketing and social exposure services.
Not affiliated with Instagram™, Meta™, or YouTube™.

Display “Digital Marketing Services (MSME Reg. No. XXXXX)” under the footer.


6️⃣ Data & Fraud Protection

Maintain secure backend logs for every order:

Fields: order_id, service_type, quantity, cost_price, sale_price, delivery_status, timestamp.


Generate downloadable monthly CSV for accounting (to support ITR/GST filing).

Implement admin panel filter for refunds and refill requests.


7️⃣ UI/UX Requirements

Footer should have visible links: Privacy Policy, Refund Policy, Disclaimer, Terms of Service, Contact Us.

Use responsive layout (mobile-friendly).

Keep professional color palette (avoid platform-specific colors).

Optional: add “Support Chat / Email” section linking to support@yourdomain.com.


8️⃣ Future Expansion (Optional)

Add version tracking for policy updates (e.g., v1.0, v1.1).

Implement admin notifications when new ToS is accepted.

Setup sitemap.xml including all legal pages for indexing.


Deliverables:

1. All five legal pages live & linked


2. Consent checkbox functional and recorded in database.
3. Footer redesign with compliance links


4. Secure HTTPS + cookie notice
